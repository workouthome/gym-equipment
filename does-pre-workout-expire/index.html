<p><strong>Does Pre Workout Expire</strong>, Most slap on an generic expiration date of 2 years however they do this without actually conducting stability tests on their products. Most ingredients will work best within date but some people will opt to use the supplement anyway. So i have a couple pre workout products that are going to expire in about 2 weeks and i know i will not be able to finish them all before they expire so i was wondering if i should just throw them out or if.</p>
